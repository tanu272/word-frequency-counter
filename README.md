## Understanding The Code

<div>
This is a Javascript application built using React library. The main logic is located inside <b>src/Button.js</b>. On button click, a function <b>getData</b> is evoked, which uses axios client to fetch data from the given API (in this case <a href="https://www.terriblytinytales.com/test.txt">https://www.terriblytinytales.com/test.txt</a>). If data cannot be fetched, the function returns an error message, otherwise it gives a call to another function <b>parsestring</b> that parses the given data and counts the frequency of all words in the data. These words along with their frequencies are stored in a state variable. 
<br/>
Next, we sort the object(by converting it into an array) and get first 20 elements from the array. We use <b>Chart.js</b> library to use this data and display it in the form of a column chart where X-axis contains the top 20 most-occuring words and Y-axis contains respective frequencies of these words.
